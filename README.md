How to use?
---

Backup your original (neo)vim settings.

In home directory, 

```
git clone https://github.com/jtr860830/.vim.git .config/nvim
```

use (neo)vim to open any file, and `:PlugInstall`.

And you should install one of [nerd-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).

**My environment is Fedora + NeoVim. It is recommend to use NeoVim for best experience**
