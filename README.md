How to use?
---

Backup your original `.vimrc` and `.vim` settings.

In home directory, 

```
git clone https://github.com/jtr860830/.vim.git
```
or if you are neovim user
```
git clone https://github.com/jtr860830/.vim.git && ln -s $HOME/.vim/vimrc $HOME/.config/nvim/init.vim
```

use vim to open any file, vim plugin will be automatically installed.

And you should install a font can support powerline.

My environment is OSX + iterm2 + neovim.
