How to use?
---

Backup your original `.vimrc` and `.vim` settings.

In home directory, 

```
git clone https://github.com/jtr860830/.vim.git
```
or if you are a neovim user just look
```
:help nvim-from-vim
```

use (neo)vim to open any file, vim plugin will be automatically installed.

And you should install a font can support powerline.

My environment is OSX + iterm2 + neovim.
